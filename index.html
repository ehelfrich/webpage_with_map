      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The webpage presents visualized data from the bike sharing system in Washington DC.
        Capital Bike share is the mainstay for the bike sharing service in the city with more than
        4500 bikes and 596 stations across the metro region of Washington,DC. The data was
        obtained from the Website of Capitalbike share <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com">
          https://www.capitalbikeshare.com</a>. The data incorporates several layers of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bike IDs</li>
        <li>Time/Location data</li>
        <li>Membership of user</li>
        <li>Bike Type</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The data visulalized is from January to April of 2021. We combined the Capital Bikeshare data with land use
        data from the Washington DC data portal. We then calculated total trip times from the start and end times. The
        trips latitude and longitude points were used trip distances and find what land use cluster related to a
        trips start and end locations. The data has been cleaned by removing trips with null values and trips that were
        started on accident. These accidental trips were identified by finding trips under 2 mins long and had a length
        of under 200m.
      </p>
      <p><b>By analyzing and visualizing the data we are trying to answer the following questions:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li> DC Capital Bikeshare has an annual membership tier for frequent riders and locals. How does this membership
          tier change the riding habits
          of users? We look at trip distance and time for the two groups and compare them across the hours of the day.
        </li>
        <li>Do users that have a membership start their ride from different locations then non-members? We look at if
          travel patterns change based on membership.</li>
        <li>We classified areas of Washington DC based on their land use type. Does having a membership change what sort
          of areas of Washington DC bike users travel between?</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>Daily behavior pattern differences between members and casual users</h3>
      <p>
        Travel time was calculated by subtracting the end time by the start time. Travel distance was calculated by
        finding the distance between the start and end latitude/longitude points for each ride. This distance was simply
        the cartesian distance between these points. The trips do not contain periodic GPS coordinates for the ride and
        therefore we can get an accurate picture of the route the user chose for their trip. This leads to some
        interesting results where we have trips that were checked out for long periods of time, but did not go anywhere.
        These bikes were most likely checked out and then returned to the same station after the user took a circular
        route.
      </p>
      <h4>Total start-end distance variation</h4>
      <div id="distance_plot"></div>
      <h5>Members</h5>
      <p>
        The total distance keeps lower than 50,000km between 23pm to 5am the next day, then it starts
        to surge at 6 am and reaches the first peak around 8am. After a slight decline during 9 to 10 am,
        the total distance starts to rise more and reaches to the second peak around 5pm. In general
        the total distance of rides in the afternoon are higher than that in the morning. That is either
        because people in the afternoon use shared bikes to travel to farther destinations or the number
        of member users increases in the afternoon. Moreover, as the two peaks appear during the rush
        hours of the day, we can speculate that most of the member users probably use sharing bike
        service to commute.
      </p>
      <h5>Casual users</h5>
      <p>
        The total start-end distance for the rides of the casual users are lower than that of the members
        at any hour of the day. No obvious peak can be seen in the graph and the curve of the profile is
        much smoother, which suggests that the ridership of the casual users has little to do with the
        behavior pattern of the commuters. The other thing we can observe is that the distance is higher
        from 12 to 5 pm than the rest of the day. That means casual users prefer to take rides in the
        afternoon than in the morning.
      </p>
      <h4>Total duration variation</h4>
      <div id="time_plot"></div>
      <h5>Members</h5>
      <p>
        Unlike the graph of the distance, there is no drastic rise and fall in the duration graph. However,
        we can still see the connection between the total duration and the total distance: The duration
        stays low at night and becomes high from 7am to 8pm and the highest point is at 5pm.In
        addition, the duration of trips in the afternoon is also higher than that in the morning. The
        similarities and difference between the duration graph and distance graph suggests that the total
        duration of the trips is to some degree related to the total distance but also impacted by other
        factors such as traffic conditions, the users riding speed, etc.
      </p>
      <h5>Casual users</h5>
      <p>
        There is a sharp increase of total duration at 10 am, and it reaches to the highest level between
        1 to 4pm. What’s more, opposite to the distance graph, the total duration of casual users is
        significantly higher than that of members. The reason behind this is unknown, but it may
        probably be due to the purpose of the trips of casual users. For instance, if the casual users are
        riding the bikes mostly for leisure purposes, the trips may be slow and circulating, which leads to
        a longer duration and shorter start-end distance. We may need other types of data to further
        testify this hypothesis.
      </p>
      <h5>Impact</h5>
      <p>
        We see that membership does make a difference when looking at aggregate travel distances and times.
        Knowing these differences in behviour patterns between members and non-members can help target how the
        two different populations are using the bikeshare program. This can be used to help target new members and
        refine the structure of memberships to increase revenue.

      <h3>Membership has minimal impact on commuting patterns</h3>
      <p>
        The data was split by commuting time to analyze patterns between the morning and evening commutes. This was done
        by defining two time frames for the commuting times and then separating the rides into those bins. We defined 6
        am to 10am as the morning commute and 5pm - 8pm as the evening commute. We filtered the data by these two times
        and by their membership type and plotted them on a heat map. This heat map shows the start or end locations by
        each of the combinations of start/end/membership type. We chose a heat map because it allowed us to capture the
        trip locations that started or ended in a public bike rack in addition to the bikeshare stations. We expanded
        the dimensionality of the heat map by allowing the commute time to be changed by two buttons. This will allow us
        to view the heat maps for the morning commute and evening commute.
      </p>

        <h4>
          Findings
        </h4>
        <p>
          The heat maps show the start and the end locations for the bike share system for morning
          and evening commutes to analyse the travel patterns.
          Start and End locations for the members do not vary as bikes are used to commute to work
          and back, while the start and end locations for the casual riders change for both morning
          and evening commute concentrating over the leisure specialized places. This finding is interesting because we
          would have expected members are more likely to be using the bikeshare for daily commuting when compared to
          casual users. These findings point to both members and non-members using bikes for commuting almost at the
          same rate and with the same geographic distribution.  This means that the geographic distribution of trip endpoints
          is not a useful metric for enhancing the Capital bikeshare membership program.

          <h3>Membership changes how riders move between areas of Washington DC</h3>
          <p>
            We used arcGIS to visualize the shape file of land use designations for DC. We found that the designations
            were so fine grain that most bikes would be placed in the locations designated as roads. In order to get
            information about the area the trips endpoints we manually grouped areas of DC by their most common land use
            area. We did this manually by examining the current land use designations and drawing new shapes over the DC
            map. We designated these new clusters as commercial, mixed use, open/public, residential, or the National
            Mall. Each of these clusters were categorized based off of the most common land use designation in them. The
            National Mall was a special class for open/public land as it is one of the most common tourist spots in DC
            and encompasses a large portion of downtown DC. We then mapped each ride's start and end location to their
            cluster and added it to our dataset. Since our data only included the District of Columbia we decided to
            remove all trips that originate or terminated outside of DC for just the land use analysis.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Trips related to registered members represent 65.48 % of the overall trips. The share of registered
              members based on land use types are as follow:

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Here are some other features that can be visualized by using both the land use map and the chord graphs:
            </li>
            <li>Trips from mixed-use zone (for both registered members and casual users) are essentially made within the
              mixed-use zone and to commercial areas and the National Mall area.</li>
            <li>Compared to casual users, registered users traveled more within the mixed-use.</li>
            <li>There are fewer trips to the open and public areas (lake, river, canal, not yet developed areas, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>No trip to residential areas for both casual and registered users. So, they either live in the
              mixed-use
              areas or use CABI for their first or last mile.</li>
            <li>No trip within the residential areas. This could be explained by the very few available stations in
              these
              areas.</li>
            <li>Important number of trips from mixed-use to commercial areas. This could be also explained by the fact
              that commercial zones are coupled with institutional, office, industrial areas.</li>
            <li>Trips from commercial areas are exclusively within the same zones.</li>
            <li>One big difference between registered and casual users is the number of trips within and from the
              National
              Mall area. This is explained by the fact that this area attracts a lot of tourists, potential casual
              users.</li>
