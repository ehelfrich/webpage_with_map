      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The webpage presents visualized data from the bike sharing system in Washington DC.
        Capital Bike share is the mainstay for the bike sharing service in the city with more than
        4500 bikes and 596 stations across the metro region of Washington,DC. The data was
        obtained from the Website of Capitalbike share <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com">
          https://www.capitalbikeshare.com</a>. The data incorporates several layers of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bike IDs</li>
        <li>Time/Location data</li>
        <li>Membership of user</li>
        <li>Bike Type</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p><b>By analyzing and visualizing the data we are trying to answer the following questions:</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>How does rider membership impact the user of bike share system for commuting and non-commuting?</li>
        <li>Do the travel patterns change based on membership or casual trips?</li>
        <li>Does having a membership change the area that users start their trip?</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How does rider membership impact the use of the bike share system for commuting and non-commuting?</h3>
      <p>Ride distance and time are average over a 24 hour day for the first 4 months of 2021.</p>
      <div id="distance_plot"></div>
      <div id="time_plot"></div>
      <h4>
        Findings
      </h4>
      <p>
        First of all, we can see two peaks existing in the ridership of the members both in the first and second graph.
        That means most of the member users are using the bike sharing service for daily commuting,
        which causes the volume of the usage to rise at rush hours of the day.
        In addition, there is a distinct difference of ridership between members and casual users.
        Member users have a longer distance of rides but a much lower duration than the casual users do for
        almost the entire range of times. There are two possible reasons behind this.
        First, member users ride faster than the casual users because the member users are usually in
        a hurry to work or go home. Second, since casual users are using bikes for leisure purposes,
        they may take a circular tour path, which leads to a longer time and shorter start-end distances.

      <p>Start and stop locations are plotted in this heat map. Buttons allow you to change your view between morning
        (6am-10am) and evening(5pm-8pm) commute times. Data is from January 2021 - April 2021.</p>

          Findings

        <p>
          The heat maps show the start and the end locations for the bike share system for morning
          and evening commutes to analyse the travel patterns.
          Start and End locations for the members do not vary as bikes are used to commute to work
          and back, while the start and end locations for the casual riders change for both morning
          and evening commute concentrating over the leisure specialized places.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Trips related to registered members represent 65.48 % of the overall trips. The share of registered
              members based on land use types are as follow:

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Here are some other features that can be visualized by using both the land use map and the chord graphs:
            </li>
            <li>Trips from mixed-use zone (for both registered members and casual users) are essentially made within the
              mixed-use zone and to commercial areas and the National Mall area.</li>
            <li>Compared to casual users, registered users traveled more within the mixed-use.</li>
            <li>There are fewer trips to the open and public areas (lake, river, canal, not yet developed areas, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>No trip to residential areas for both casual and registered users. So, they either live in the
              mixed-use
              areas or use CABI for their first or last mile.</li>
            <li>No trip within the residential areas. This could be explained by the very few available stations in
              these
              areas.</li>
            <li>Important number of trips from mixed-use to commercial areas. This could be also explained by the fact
              that commercial zones are coupled with institutional, office, industrial areas.</li>
            <li>Trips from commercial areas are exclusively within the same zones.</li>
            <li>One big difference between registered and casual users is the number of trips within and from the
              National
              Mall area. This is explained by the fact that this area attracts a lot of tourists, potential casual
              users.</li>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Registered members commute for longer distances compared to casual users.</li>
            <li>Casual users spend more time in commuting than registered users.</li>
            <li>Both casual and registered users commute mostly on wednesday (between 4 PM and 6 PM for registered
              users
              and between 2 PM and 4 PM for casual users).</li>
            <li>High concentration areas of bicycling activities for both registered and casual users are located
              essentially in the city center and Columbia Heights area.</li>
            <li>No trip to residential areas from other land use categories for both casual and registered users.</li>
            <li>Casual users traveled more within the National Mall whereas registered users spend most of their trips
